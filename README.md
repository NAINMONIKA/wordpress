# WordPress on Kubernetes Cluster — Step-by-Step Guide

## Introduction:

WordPress is a popular Content Management System (CMS) that allows you to create and manage websites easily. Kubernetes is a powerful container orchestration platform that can help you deploy and manage WordPress with high availability and scalability.

This guide will walk you through setting up WordPress on a Kubernetes cluster using a MySQL StatefulSet for database storage. We will provide you with the necessary deployment files, secret files, Persistent Volume (PV) and Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) files, and service files to get you started.

## Prerequisites:

Before we dive into setting up WordPress on Kubernetes, you’ll need the following prerequisites:

-->1 A running Kubernetes cluster.
-->2 kubectl command-line tool configured to interact with your Kubernetes cluster.
-->3 Helm, a package manager for Kubernetes. You can install Helm by following the official documentation: https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/ — Optional (for this example not needed)

### Step 1: Create MySQL StatefulSet
  #### We will begin by creating a MySQL StatefulSet. Save the following content to a file named mysql-statefulset.yaml:

```sh
kubectl apply -f mysql-statefulset.yaml
```

### Step2: Create Mysql Service
